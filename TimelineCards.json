I was able to earn through my own ecommerce store which I built in 2016 and run with my wife (who is in marketing). The store is built on the Shopify platform and it's been a great way for me to learn all aspects of owning and running a business (not just the development side of Shopify). My freelance work has involved short-term 'Drupal 8', 'Shopify' and 'Big Commerce' projects, while in my freetime I've been learning React. Despite the success of the store and our fun travelling, my wife and I want to put our roots down, sell the store and focus on our careers in the UK.",
